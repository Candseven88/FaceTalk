# üìò FaceTalk Project ‚Äì Phase 1: Core Functional Modules

## üéØ Project Goal
Build a multi-functional AI video app named **FaceTalk** using Next.js (App Router) and Tailwind CSS. The app must integrate 3 core features based on Replicate models. All API calls must go through backend routes using `process.env.REPLICATE_API_TOKEN`. Never expose API keys in frontend code.
