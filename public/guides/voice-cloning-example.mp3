PLACEHOLDER FOR VOICE CLONING AUDIO EXAMPLE

In a real implementation, this would be an MP3 file containing:
1. A sample of the original voice
2. The same text spoken in the cloned voice
3. A demonstration of different intonations and styles

This file would be replaced with an actual MP3 demonstrating the Voice Cloning feature's capabilities.
